• List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
  1. Javascript Operations
     - Javascript Operations allows us to perform arithmetic problems using given data and values.
       There are several operations but the basic ones are the arithmetic operations and comparison operations like =, ==, ===, etc.
  2. Variable Declaration
     - Variable Declaration is the process of making a variable to store in given data/values.
       We have several ways to declare variables but the main three keywords are: var, let, and const.
  3. Loop Control Structures
     - Loop Control Structures are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is true.
       The common used loop statements are for loops, while loops, do loops, and if (or if else) loops.
  4. Javascript Basic Statements
     - Javascript Basic Statements are like the structure and building tools of code to tell a program what to do.
       These are followed step by step stated by the programmer.
  5. Control Statements
     - Control Statements are the guide of the program by making statements to control the codes or how it works based on the given conditions.
     - Commonly used control statements are if, else, switch, and some loops like for and while.

• List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  
1. Coding sequences
   - It is quite hard for me to make sequences because there can be too many ways to code it or just the complexity of the sequence in general.
     An example I really struggle at is the Fibonacci sequence.
2. Event Handlers
   - It is difficult for me because sometimes, I don't know what event condition I'm gonna put.
     I also sometimes don't know how to code it especially when it comes to detecting mouse clicks.

Fortunately, I don't really struggle that much anymore with other topics and these two are the only ones I really need to focus on.

• Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
  - I will study more on JavaScript codes and I will also watch YouTube videos about the topics that I am struggling on.
  - There are many coding channels out there who can help me improve my knowledge on coding JavaScript.

• In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
  1. JavaScript operations
     - JavaScript operations are very useful because they are one of the common and basic things we need to know in pretty much every single coding language out there. It is a way to solve basic arithmetic obstacles.
  3. Variable Declarations
     - This is another basic and common topic trhat we need to know for every other coding language as well. Variables help store data and make it easier for the programmer.
  • For me, all the exercises were very helpful and they helped me a lot. Even though there were obstcles that I had to come across, solving them helped me become a smarter person in the subject of coding.
